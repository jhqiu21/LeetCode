# :simple-leetcode: LeetCode Notes

This is Notes of LeetCode Question which I have tried and found it interesting! And I will also summarize the important methodology based on the questions I tried before.

The questions I did are mostly based on [this list](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/). And I also refer to [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) to make plans!
