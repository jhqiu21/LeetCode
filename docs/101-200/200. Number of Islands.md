# 200. Number of Islands
**Source:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)
## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Traverse the grid array using DFS. Check every entry in the array and use `count` to store the number of island.
## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
When we visit a cell in the grid, we set its value as `'0'`, as when we encounter the cell with '0', we simply ignore it and visit next cell. The invalid case for DFS is 

- `row < 0 || row >= grid.length`
- `col < 0 || col >= grid[0].length`
- `grid[row][col] != '1'`

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(R \times C)$, in the worst case, we need to visit every cell in the grid.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $O(R \times C)$, in the worst case, all cells in the grid are land cells, thus DFS will be called $R\times C$ times
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

## Code
``` java linenums="1"
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int row = grid.length;
        int col = grid[0].length;
        boolean isCheck[][] = new boolean[row][col];
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        if (row < 0 || row >= grid.length || 
            col < 0 || col >= grid[0].length || 
            grid[row][col] != '1') {
            return ;
        }
        grid[row][col] = '0';
        dfs(grid, row + 1, col);
        dfs(grid, row, col + 1);
        dfs(grid, row - 1, col);
        dfs(grid, row, col - 1);
    }
