## Intuition
Give a list of number, find maximum volumn between two entries given that 
$$
\text{Volumn} = \min(\text{nums}[i],\text{nums}[j]) \times (j - i)
$$
for $0 \le i < j < \text{len}$
## Approach
Use Sliding Windows approach.

- Step 1:
    - creat two pointer `low` and `high` pointing to the start and end position of the given array.
    - creat variable `max` to store the max value we ever get and keep updating max during loop iteration.
- Step 2: During loop iteration, 
    - If `height[low] < height[high]`, move `low` pointer until current height is less than or equal to `height[low]`.
    - If `height[low] >= height[high]`, move `high` pointer until current height is less than or equal to `height[height]`.
- Hence, in every loop, we will get a higher height than the previous one. The loop iteration ends when two pointer encounters. Finally, we return the maximum value of volumn we get during iteration.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Code
``` java linenums="1"
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = height.length - 1;
        int volumn = 0;
        int h = 0;
        while (low < high) {
            h = Math.min(height[low], height[high]);
            volumn = Math.max(h * (high - low), volumn);
            if (height[low] < height[high]) {
                low++;
                while(low < high && h > height[low]) { 
                    low++;
                }
                h = height[low];
            } else {
                high--;
                while(low < high && h > height[high]) { 
                    high--;
                }
                h = height[high];
            }
        }
        return volumn;
    }
}
```
