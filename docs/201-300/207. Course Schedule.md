## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We traverse the graph and find if there is a topological 

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Create a 1-d array `visit` to record the visit status, with 3 states:
    - 0 means it has not been visited
    - 1 means it has been visited
    - -1 means there is a conflict
- Firstly, build a directed graph, and then start from the first course, find which course it can constitute, temporarily mark the current course as visited
- Call DFS recursion on the newly obtained course until a new course has been visited, then return false, if there is no conflict, return true, and then change the course marked as visited to unvisited.
## Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(V+E)$
- Space complexity: $O(V)$
